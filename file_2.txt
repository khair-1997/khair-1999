Even in my present life, my childhood neighborhood continues to be significant. It's a place I return to when seeking solace and a sense of belonging. The lessons I learned about community and unity here have informed my values as an adult. Although I've moved away, the spirit of my childhood neighborhood continues to shape my interactions with the world.
